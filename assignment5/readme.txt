All functionality of the program should work, but there are memory leaks. 
I didn't put the insert, push_back, or push_front functions in main explicitly,
because it was explained on Piazza that they just have to work, but not necessarily
be implemented in the driver. They do work, feel free to test them if needed. They are
insert(value,index), push_back(value), push_front(value).

I did not do any extra credit. I think the memory leaks should be the only problem with the program
as far as the rubric goes.


Thanks and have a good break! Stay safe!
